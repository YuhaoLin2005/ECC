config-health — runtime configuration integrity monitoring for Claude Code.

Deterministic, read-only, non-blocking monitor. Complements delivery-gate:
delivery-gate blocks at session end (missing growth-log = not retroactively
fixable); config-health warns during the session (config drift = fixable).

Modes:
  --startup   SessionStart: audit hook wiring, rule references, guard staleness.
  --pretool   PreToolUse:   re-verify hook scripts exist and are wired.
              The audit runs on every call: "does this file exist" is a
              property of the settings files, not of the tool being run, so
              gating it on the tool class would trade a property we can prove
              (every call is verified) for one we cannot (a mutation is
              imminent). Measured on this repository's own 23 hook commands,
              the audit is 3.8 ms against a ~55 ms process, so there is
              nothing there to gate. The hook payload is drained and
              discarded, never parsed, never printed.
  --check     Manual:       tri-color health overview on stdout, plus the
              coverage counts for what was left unjudged.

Contract (from the ECC config-health skill):
  - read-only   — never writes to disk
  - non-blocking — always exits 0, even on malformed input
  - no leak      — --pretool never prints raw hook input, or a whole hook
                  command; only the one path it could not find
  - deterministic — the same settings files, the same CONFIG_HEALTH_*
                    environment and the same working directory give
                    byte-identical output. The working directory is in that
                    list because it is the fallback for an unset project dir.
                    What the findings depend on is listed under "Env inputs"
                    below; it is not the process environment.
  - asymmetric  — a path that cannot be built is skipped, not reported, and a
                  relative path is only reported when it is missing under
                  every audited root. The bias is deliberate and one-sided:
                  silence costs a missed check, a false warning costs the
                  user's trust in every other line this hook prints. Every
                  thing the monitor declines to judge is counted, and --check
                  prints the counts, because silence nobody can see is not a
                  verdict.

Env inputs (what the findings depend on, and nothing else):
  - the working directory — the fallback project dir when CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR is
    unset, and the fallback user home when CONFIG_HEALTH_USER_HOME is unset
  - CONFIG_HEALTH_USER_HOME  — user home; also what `~` and $HOME resolve to
  - CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR       — project dir
  - CONFIG_HEALTH_PLUGIN_ROOT / CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT — plugin root

Hook command placeholders:
  - $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT, $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR, $HOME and $USERPROFILE are
    expanded from an explicit allowlist, so a normal plugin install no longer
    reports every hook as referencing a missing script. Any other placeholder
    is left alone and the token is skipped — this monitor does not guess at
    provider-specific paths. A single-quoted placeholder is skipped too: the
    shell does not expand it, so no path can be built from it.
  - Only the result of a substitution is checked against the audited roots.
    A bare relative path is judged under every root instead, because a hook
    command does not say which directory it runs from.

      not a file anything will open, so it is skipped;
    - a backslash only escapes what a shell would let it escape. Treating
